I'm a final-year PhD student at the VUB AI Lab, focusing on Reinforcement Learning (RL) and multi-objective decision making. My work combines mathematical foundations with practical RL algorithms. I hold a Master’s in Computer Science, with research visits to University of Galway (multi-objective RL theory) and University of Oxford (post-training LLMs with RL).
