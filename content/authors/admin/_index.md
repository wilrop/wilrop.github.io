I'm a PhD researcher at the Artificial Intelligence Lab at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel under the supervision of Roxana Rădulescu, Diederik M. Roijers and Ann Nowé. My research focuses on the intersection of multi-objective and multi-agent decision-making, where I aim to establish a theoretical foundation for these domains and develop algorithms for learning agents within them.
