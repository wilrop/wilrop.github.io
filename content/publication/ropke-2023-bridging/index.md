abstract: A classic model to study strategic decision making in multi-agent systems
  is the normal-form game. This model can be generalised to allow for an infinite
  number of pure strategies leading to continuous games. Multi-objective normal-form
  games are another generalisation that model settings where players receive separate
  payoffs in more than one objective. We bridge the gap between the two models by
  providing a theoretical guarantee that a game from one setting can always be transformed
  to a game in the other. We extend the theoretical results to include guaranteed
  equivalence of Nash equilibria. The mapping makes it possible to apply algorithms
  from one field to the other. We demonstrate this by introducing a fictitious play
  algorithm for multi-objective games and subsequently applying it to two well-known
  continuous games. We believe the equivalence relation will lend itself to new insights
  by translating the theoretical guarantees from one formalism to another. Moreover,
  it may lead to new computational approaches for continuous games when a problem
  is more naturally solved in the succinct format of multi-objective games.
