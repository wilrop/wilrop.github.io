abstract: Speech-to-text, also known as Speech Recognition, is a technology that is
  able to recognize and transcribe spoken language into text. In subsequent steps,
  this transcription can be used to complete a multitude of tasks, such as providing
  automatic subtitles or parsing voice commands. In recent years, Speech-to-Text models
  have dramatically improved thanks partially to advances in Deep Learning methods.
  Starting from the open-source project DeepSpeech, we train speech-to-text models
  for Dutch, using the Corpus Gesproken Nederlands (CGN). First, we contribute a pre-processing
  pipeline for this dataset, to make it suitable for the task at hand, obtaining a
  ready-to-use speech-to-text dataset for Dutch. Second, we investigate the performance
  of Dutch and Flemish models trained from scratch, establishing a baseline for the
  CGN dataset for this task. Finally, we investigate the issue of transferring speech-to-text
  models between related languages. In this case, we analyse how a pre-trained English
  model can be transferred and fine-tuned for Dutch.
